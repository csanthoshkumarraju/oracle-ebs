Example :- Software Programming Language
Java 
Have Two files .java is a Source Code and .class is a Compiled Code
.java is seen by the developer and .class is seen at compiler time .
# .java is developer readable format and .class is machine readable format.
# interpreter -> An interpreter translates the entire source code line by line.An interpreter translates source code into object code one instruction at a time
#Compiler -> A compiler translates the entire source code in a single run.A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code.
Parsing engine is similar as Compiler Function
JVM -> Java Virtual Machine, Software , Run time Engine.
Application Server.

#back end

Data Base where data is stored
----------
#Transaction -> Every item/product we purchase is a transaction.
#Transaction Data -> Raw Facts/Transactions . Ex :- Fruit

On cloud ->
   public,private,hybrid
